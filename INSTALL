The build system uses ant (http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/java.html).

The following commands will compile and run the code.

ant compile
ant jar
ant run


See the file build.xml

I am actually still finding it easier to compile with

javac generate_gauge.java

and then to run with 

java   generate_gauge

The code now reads some parameters from the input_param.xml
file.
